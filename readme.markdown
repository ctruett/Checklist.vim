#### CONFIGURE

#### USAGE
When starting to make a checklist, make sure to first set the filetype using:

    :set ft=chklst

To create a checklist, use `<leader>ca` in insert mode.  
To mark items as done use `<leader>cc` in normal mode.  
To fold list items use `<leader>cc` on a parent (+) item in normal mode.

Basic use is `<leader>ca` 'Name of checklist' `<CR>`, `<leader>ca` for subsequent list items, `<CR>`, etc.
