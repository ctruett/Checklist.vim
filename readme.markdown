#### INSTALL

Add the following to your .vimrc, or download and install it manually.

    Plug 'ctruett/Checklist.vim'

#### CONFIGURE
If you want timestamps, add the following line to your .vimrc:

    let g:checklist_use_timestamps = 1 " Default 0

#### USAGE

To create a checklist, use `<leader>ca` in insert mode.  
To mark items as done use `<leader>cc` in normal mode.  
To fold list items use `<leader>cc` on a parent (+) item in normal mode.

Basic use is `<leader>ca` 'Name of checklist' `<CR>`, `<leader>ca` for subsequent list items, `<CR>`, etc.

#### NOTES

If you aren't using the .chklst extension, make sure to first set the filetype using:

    :set ft=chklst

#### TODO

+ Planned features:
  * When toggling a parent item, mark all the children as completed as well (maybe?)
