============================================================================
*INSTALL*

Download latest checklist.vx.x.zip, extract it in your .vim directory:

  cd ~/.vim
  unzip /path/to/checklist.vx.x.zip

Add the following line to your .vimrc:

  au BufNewFile,BufRead *.chklst setf chklst 

*CONFIGURE*

If you want timestamps, add the following line to your .vimrc:

  let g:checklist_use_timestamps = 1 "Default 0

*USAGE*

When starting to make a checklist, make sure to first set the filetype using:

  :set ft=chklst

This will make sure that folding and the syntax highlighting work as expected.

To start making a checklist, go into insert mode and use <leader>v.
To mark a list item as done, use <leader>vv in normal mode.

Example: "* Child" becomes "× Child"

To fold a list item, use <leader>vv on a parent item while in normal mode.
